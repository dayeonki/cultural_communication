### [1] Collecting Neologisms + Meanings
- ko: NAVER Opensource Dictionary (filtered to only use terms from official neologism dictionary)
- zh-1: "Language Situation in China" 2019-2022 (in total 948 unique words where 6 words have two meanings; 1 word Âç∑ has three meanings; 98 words are marked as explicit Internet slang; some words contain placeholders xxx)
- zh-2: "Word-Splitting" 2015-2024 [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XeVljZ-ObGPoA9jepgwAoz1jX-3Y5OPpzZ0P7_zdVco) (in total 100 words but not all slangs)
- ko+zh: Gold mapping from Chinatogod website [link](http://www.chinatogod.com/main/z2_search_.php?si=0&all_search=%BD%C5%C1%B6%BE%EE%B7%CE)


### [2] Annotation Exercise 1 (with ko/zh natives)
**[Phase 1]**
- **Procedure:** Given meaning, ask for neologism
- **Goal:** Using the default meaning, can the source language natives can recover/guess back the neologism
    - If yes, use the default meaning as it is
    - If no, expand the meaning
- Ask in the survey about "how to improve the description?"
- Maybe we can give out the annotation exercise, ask them to complete in a longer time span, ask to provide feedback on which strategies you used to figure out the neologism

**[Phase 2]**
- **Procedure:** Given meaning, ask for connotation + verify meaning (any expanded meaning)
- **How to ask connotation?:** Give specific/realistic scenario (e.g., Would you use this term to appraise or criticize something/someone?)
