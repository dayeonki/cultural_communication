Processing term: bestie
"Bestie" in Korean can be translated as:

**베프 (bepeu)** — This is a slang abbreviation of "베스트 프렌드" (besteu peurendeu), which means "best friend." It's commonly used among young people.

Alternatively, you can also say:

**절친 (jeolchin)** — This means "close friend" or "best friend" and is a bit more standard than 베프.

So, you can use either **베프** or **절친**, depending on the tone and formality you want! 😊
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Processing term: deplatform
The term **"deplatform"** in Korean can be translated as:

**탈플랫폼화하다** (*tal-peul-laet-pom-hwa-ha-da*) or **플랫폼에서 퇴출시키다** (*peul-laet-pom-e-seo toe-chul-si-ki-da*).

Here’s what they mean:

1. **탈플랫폼화하다** – A more literal or technical translation meaning "to deplatform" (almost like "to remove from a platform").
2. **플랫폼에서 퇴출시키다** – This means "to expel/remove someone from a platform," which may be more natural or commonly understood in context.

In everyday Korean conversation or news, the second form (플랫폼에서 퇴출시키다) is generally preferred due to its clarity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Processing term: webseries
The word **"web series"** can be translated into Korean as:

**웹 시리즈** (pronounced *web sirijeu*)

- **웹 (web)** – short for “Internet” or “web”

So, **웹 시리즈** is the most common and widely used Korean term for "web series."
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Processing term: lollys
The word **"lollys"** (which seems to be a plural form or variant spelling of "lollies," meaning lollipops or candy in general) can be translated into Korean depending on the context:

1. **Lollipops (hard candy on a stick)** – **막대사탕** (makdae-satang)
2. **Candy / Sweets (general term)** – **사탕** (satang)

So for "lollies" in the sense of candy:  
➡️ **사탕들** (satang-deul), where **-들** indicates plural, though plural is often implied in Korean without needing **들**.

For lollipops specifically:  
➡️ **막대사탕들** (makdae-satang-deul)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Processing term: brainrot
The slang term **"brainrot"** can be translated into Korean depending on the context, as it is an informal term used to describe being excessively obsessed or consumed by something (like a show, fandom, character, etc.), to the point that it "rots your brain."

In Korean internet slang, a similar expression would be:

- **뇌절** (*noejeol*) — Literally meaning "brain cutoff," it's used when something becomes excessively repetitive or overwhelming, similar to how "brainrot" is used.
- **뇌가 썩었다** (*noega sseogeotda*) — Literally "my brain has rotted," a more direct and humorous translation, often used in fandoms or memes.

So, for example, if you're saying "I've got brainrot for this anime," you might say:

- **이 애니메이션 때문에 뇌가 썩었어.**  
*(I-e animeisyeon ttaemune noega sseogeosseo.)*  
= "My brain has rotted because of this anime."

Processing term: terpy
The word **"terpy"** is a slang term, often used in the context of cannabis culture, to describe something that has a strong, flavorful aroma or taste due to terpenes (the aromatic compounds found in many plants).

In Korean, there is no direct translation for **"terpy"**, especially since it's a slang term. However, you can try to convey the meaning based on context. Here are some options:

1. **향이 강한 (hyang-i ganghan)** – "strongly aromatic"
2. **테르펜 향이 풍부한 (tereupen hyang-i pungbuhan)** – "rich in terpene aroma"
3. **테르피한 (terepi-han)** – A possible transliteration of "terpy" for slang use in Korean (not standard, but could be used among a niche audience)

So, if you're describing a cannabis strain that's "terpy," you might say:

- **이 품종은 테르펜 향이 풍부해요.**  
  *"This strain is rich in terpene aroma."*

Processing term: omds
The abbreviation "OMDS" can stand for different things depending on context (e.g., Olympus Medical Division Systems, Oh My Damn Self, etc.).

If you're referring to slang like **"OMDS" = "Oh My Damn Self"**, a Korean translation for its intent (often used for emphasis like "by myself" or "alone with strong emotion) might be:

- **"나 혼자서 다 했어!"** (I did it all by myself!)  
- Or more literally: **"오 마이 댐 셀프"** (a transliteration, not commonly used)

If it's in a professional or technical context (e.g., **OMDS** as a company or device name), it might not be translated at all in Korean and just referred to by the acronym.

Let me know the context, and I’ll give you a more accurate translation.

Processing term: freshie
The term **"freshie"**, which is an informal slang for **"freshman"** (a first-year student), can be translated into Korean as:

### **신입생 (sin-ip-saeng)**

- **신입 (sin-ip)** = new
- **생 (saeng)** = student

This is the standard and appropriate term used in schools and universities in Korea.

If you're referring to "freshie" in a casual or playful tone (like students might use colloquially), Koreans might still just say **신입생**, though they might add a playful tone or alternative nicknames, but there's no widely used slang equivalent for "freshie" that's a direct transliteration.

So in summary:
